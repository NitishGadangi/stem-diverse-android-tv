# STEM DIVERSE TV
TV app promoting diversity in Science, Technology, Enginering, and Mathematics (STEM).

Technology is a part of our life which has the potential to remove boundaries between people in terms of career and development. We want to promote schools, universities, programs, companies, etc. which recruit and support diversity in STEM.

Bringing diversity to the technical and STEM fields has to be multi-dimensional and requires collaboration between educators, governments, corporations, nonprofits, and grassroots community groups to succeed. To me, success is a world where women and men of all ages design, create, drive, and own equally. Letâ€™s continue to inspire, invest, create, and work together to make this future a reality.

Since TV apps are getting more popular in streaming content than mobile apps it is reasonable to provide TV apps to promote diversity in STEM. The first version of MVP consists of the following features.

* Backend Rest API providing videos inspiring in matters of diversity in STEM.
* AndroidTV app build to provide the implementation for the API.
* App is build focusing the designing principles of TV to provide frictionless navigation interface to the User.
