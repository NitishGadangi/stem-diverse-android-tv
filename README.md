### Best practices

1. Try to do a root cause analysis for the issue, if applicable.
2. Reference the issue being fixed in the corresponding PR.
3. Use meaningful commit messages in a PR.
4. Use one commit per task. Do not over commit (add unnecessary commits for a single task) or under commit (merge 2 or more tasks in one commit).
5. Add screenshot/short video in case the changes made in the PR, are being reflected in the UI of the application.
6. Close the issue as soon as the corresponding PR is accepted/closed.

### Some don'ts

1. Send a MR without an existing issue.
2. Fix an issue assigned to somebody else and submit a PR before the assignee does.
3. Report issues which are previously reported by others. (Please check both the open and closed issues).
4. Suggest unnecessary or completely new features in the issue list.
5. Add unnecessary spacing or indentation to the code.
